# National Museum Foundation of Korea
![MainVisual](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f863024-ea62-40c6-b099-cdb24e5a8a4e)

<br/><br/>

**A personal project to redesign the National Museum Foundation of Korea website, aimed at strengthening institutional identity and improving user journey**
> This project is a personal redesign work that clearly conveys the institution's core message and allows users to quickly find the information they need. The main page prioritizes institutional identity and key guidance, hierarchizes detailed content into 6 sub-pages, and improves information accessibility through search, filter, and calendar-based navigation features. UI maintainability was enhanced through componentized elements (modals, swipers, tabs, etc.), implemented with React and deployed via Netlify.

## Overview
### Background
The National Museum Foundation of Korea is a Korean institution that plans and develops exhibitions for the National Museum of Korea and affiliated museums nationwide, as well as performances for the specialized performance venue 'Yong' Theater within the National Museum of Korea. It also operates MU:DS, a product brand inspired by cultural heritage housed in museums, and publishes exhibition catalogs and research reports. However, the existing website failed to effectively communicate these business activities and lacked design considerations for brand value and user engagement.

<br/>

**Information Architecture Confusion**     
- Separate 'About Us' main page causing disconnection in information flow   
- Navigation menu structure not aligned with user journey      

**Weak Brand Message**   
- Lack of content explaining the foundation's identity, business, and values   
- Difficult for users to intuitively understand "what kind of institution this is"
  
**UI/UX Inconsistency**    
- Overall excessive use of slides with insufficient spacing between content     
- Poor usability due to lack of interaction feedback (hover, click, etc.)      

<br/>

### Purpose
**Main Page Structure Improvement**      
- Integrate the previously separated 'About Us' and main content into one structure, allowing users to naturally follow the information flow.

**Brand Identity Strengthening**    
- Clearly reveal the role and values of the National Museum Foundation of Korea, and effectively communicate key business messages such as the MU:DS brand visually.

**User Experience Enhancement (UX)**          
- Improve inefficient layouts and enhance readability and navigation convenience through spacing, typography, etc.

**Navigation Structure Reorganization**       
- Increase information accessibility with a menu structure tailored to user journey, and structurally reorganize repetitive content.

<br/>

### Keywords
`Refined`
- Not overly flashy or excessive interactions, but restrained and dignified layout   
  
`Immersive`
- Deeply showcases cultural and artistic content, seamlessly continuing the user's exploration experience

`Information-Centered`
- UI doesn't interfere with content delivery and guides information-centered visual flow

**Summary**
- Created `search box` as a component and placed it at the top for information search.
- `Ongoing` / `Upcoming` / `Ended` buttons exist for primary `filtering` of performance and exhibition information.
- Used `Tag` in the existing `Performances & Exhibitions` data for secondary `filtering`.
- `Filtering` results appear in the componentized `Swiper` created on the main page.
